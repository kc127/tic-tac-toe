# tic-tac-toe

Make a command line tic-tac-toe game from scratch for two players.

Expected features
===============
* Minimal UI that redraws the board and makes clear whose turn it is, each turn.
* Players can submit moves (assume, admittedly unrealistically, that both players are sitting at the same keyboard).
* Win detection - detect and display who won

Bonus / stretch goals (any or all of the following)
=======================================
* Structure your code such that the UI can be turned easily into a native mobile app (iOS say) without having to rewrite the core game logic.
* Implement win detection with a functional rather than iterative style.
* Between moves, rotate the board 90 degrees counter-clockwise. The moves "fall" due to "gravity", post-rotation.

Implementation instructions
=======================
* Create the project from scratch. Don't just clone an existing project.
* This includes writing configuration files for any dependencies and test framework setup.
* You should have a reasonably thorough suite of unit tests using a real unit test framework.
* Use the editor of your choice.
* Init a git repo for this project.
* Push the repo up to github.
* Make small commits as you go to illustrate your thought process and be able to back out changes easily.
* Don't forget to push your final solution up to Github.
* Add a professional-looking README file with installation and usage instructions.
